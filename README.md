# back end for a tournament organizer with swiss paring

#### npm install after download - to compile dependencies

#### NodeJs + Mongoose + Express + Tournament Organizer

#### Using https://github.com/ptarjan/node-cache to keep manager in cache

## The idea of this project is to serve swiss pairing for Magic The Gathering tournaments
## using Tournament Organizer to manage all the players and rounds.

## As I am caching just in memory, put only two players for the endpoints to use the nextRound() in action
## If you wanna see more player, should target a database or local storage (npm i node-localstorage)
